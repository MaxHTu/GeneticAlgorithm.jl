# Evaluation

This file contains a collection of common optimization test functions implemented in Julia to test the performance of the Genetic Algorithm. The functions are based on the paper [ON BENCHMARKING FUNCTIONS FOR GENETIC ALGORITHMS](https://web.archive.org/web/20190302201555id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a8fe/54b39bd06fd703520bbd134c08a87e0baff0.pdf).
